# Artifact Virtual Documentation

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

This repository contains the documentation for Artifact Virtual, a platform for structured knowledge systems, AI ecosystems, and tools that empower creation.

## About

Artifact Virtual exists at the edge of chaos, operating as a scalpel to skim away the bloated excess of mainstream digital life. It's not a product; it's a paradox in motionâ€”a rebellion against stagnation and a framework for thinking and evolving.

## Content Structure

- **Journal**: Raw, unfiltered frameworks and thoughts
- **Manifesto**: A compass to navigate the uncharted territories of the self
- **Research Papers**: In-depth explorations of robotics, uncertainty, and intelligence
- **Reference**: Technical documentation and specifications

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
