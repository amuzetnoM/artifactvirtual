## Component Details

### 1. Watchdog Process

**Purpose**: Ensure the core dependency manager service stays running at all times.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Implemented as a simple, lightweight process that monitors the core service
- Uses OS-specific methods for persistence (systemd on Linux, Windows Service, launchd on macOS)
- Monitors process health and restarts if necessary
- Maintains logs of restart events and failures

**Key Features**:
- Starts automatically on system boot
- Low resource utilization (~1-2% CPU, minimal RAM)
- Graceful handling of planned shutdowns vs crashes
- Configurable retry behavior with exponential backoff

### 2. Core Service Orchestrator

**Purpose**: Coordinate all dependency management activities and maintain state.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Python-based central service using asyncio for concurrency
- State management with sqlite for persistence
- Event-driven architecture using pub/sub pattern
- REST API for manual control and monitoring

**Key Features**:
- Centralized configuration management
- Activity logging and telemetry
- Component lifecycle management
- Task scheduling and prioritization

### 3. File Watcher Service

**Purpose**: Monitor the file system for changes to dependency-related files.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses OS file system notification APIs (inotify, FSEvents, ReadDirectoryChangesW)
- Efficient change detection with minimal polling
- Filter system to focus on relevant file patterns
- Change queue with debouncing to avoid processing storms

**Key Features**:
- Supports glob patterns for selective monitoring
- Configurable ignore patterns (node_modules, .git, etc.)
- Intelligent detection of dependency declarations in code
- Event batching for performance

### 4. LLM Engine with RAG Chain

**Purpose**: Provide intelligent analysis of dependencies and suggest improvements.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses TinyLlama (700MB model size) or similar efficient LLM
- GGUF quantized format for optimal performance
- RAG implementation using small, focused vector store
- Integration with dependency databases and security advisories

**Key Features**:
- Dependency knowledge base embeddings
- Context-aware dependency recommendations
- Security vulnerability identification
- Best practice suggestions

### 5. Dependency Manager

**Purpose**: Analyze and reconcile dependency requirements across projects.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Parser implementations for various dependency formats
- Resolution algorithm for dependency conflicts
- Dependency graph management
- Version compatibility analysis

**Key Features**:
- Cross-project dependency resolution
- Detection of conflicting requirements
- Minimization of dependency bloat
- Dependency tree visualization

### 6. Multi-Language Package Installers

**Purpose**: Execute dependency installation for multiple language ecosystems.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Wrapper modules for package managers (pip, npm, cargo, etc.)
- Parallel installation capability with resource limits
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Installation verification

**Key Features**:
- Support for Python (pip, conda)
- Support for JavaScript/TypeScript (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Support for Rust (cargo)
- Support for blockchain tools (Hardhat, Foundry)
- Virtual environment and containerization awareness

## Data Flow

1. **File Change Detection**:
   - File Watcher detects changes in dependency files
   - Changes are logged and queued for processing
   - Core Service is notified of pending change events

2. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Changed files are parsed to extract dependency information
   - Dependency graph is updated with new information
   - Conflicts and issues are identified

3. **LLM-Powered Analysis**:
   - Dependency context is passed to LLM Engine
   - RAG retrieval enhances LLM with dependency knowledge
   - LLM generates installation recommendations and improvements

4. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - Dependencies are prioritized for installation
   - Conflicts are resolved based on defined policies
   - Installation plan is generated

5. **Installation Execution**:
   - Appropriate language-specific installer is invoked
   - Installation is performed with appropriate isolation
   - Results are verified and logged

6. **Service Health Monitoring**:
   - Watchdog continuously monitors service health
   - Performance metrics are collected
   - Service is restarted if issues are detected

## State Management

The system maintains several types of state information:

1. **System State**:
   - Service status and health metrics
   - Startup/shutdown history
   - Error logs and recovery actions

2. **Dependency State**:
   - Current installed dependencies across all projects
   - Dependency graph with relationships
   - Version history and upgrade paths

3. **File State**:
   - Tracked file registry
   - Last modified timestamps
   - Change history for dependency files

4. **Task State**:
   - Pending installation tasks
   - Task history and results
   - Failed tasks for retry

## Performance Considerations

- Lightweight monitoring with minimal CPU utilization when idle
- Efficient file change detection to minimize overhead
- LLM model loaded on demand or kept in memory based on usage patterns
- Database indexing for fast dependency lookups
- Throttling mechanisms for resource-intensive operations

## Security Considerations

- No elevated permissions required for normal operation
- Package integrity verification
- Secure credential handling for private package repositories
- Vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- Sandboxed installation environments when possible

## Integration Points

- VS Code extension for interactive dependency management
- CLI for manual control and status reporting
- Log integration with system logging facilities
- Startup integration with system boot sequence
- Telemetry API for monitoring dashboard

## Extensibility

- Plugin system for additional language support
- Custom policy definitions for dependency resolution
- Configurable LLM backends (models can be swapped)
- Custom rulesets for best practice recommendations
