# Getting Started with Artifact Virtual

Artifact Virtual is a modular platform for AI, blockchain, and Web3 development. This guide will help you set up your environment and get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.11+** and **pip**
- **Node.js 20+** and **npm**
- **Git** and **Git LFS**
- **curl**
- **CMake** (for some dependencies)
- **Hardhat** (for blockchain development)

For GPU acceleration (optional):
- **CUDA Toolkit 11.8+** (NVIDIA)
- **ROCm** (AMD)
- **OneAPI** (Intel)

## Installation

### Automated Setup

The fastest way to get started is with our automated setup script:

```bash
python startup.py
```

This script will:
1. Check your system for required dependencies
2. Create a Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
3. Install all Python dependencies
4. Set up Ollama with required models
5. Initialize AutoRound for model quantization
6. Prepare the development environment
7. Set up Hardhat and blockchain templates

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup or encounter issues:

1. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Activate on Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # Activate on macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install Node.js dependencies (for documentation):
   ```bash
   cd frontend/celestial-chaos
   npm install
   cd ../..
   ```
4. Install Hardhat (for blockchain):
   ```bash
   npm install --global hardhat
   ```
5. Install Ollama (optional):
   - [Ollama installation instructions](https://ollama.ai/download)
   - After installation, pull the required models:
   ```bash
   ollama pull phi4-mini
   ollama pull gemma3
   ```

## Development Environment

### VS Code DevContainer

For the most seamless setup, use VS Code with our pre-configured DevContainer:

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Open the ArtifactVirtual folder in VS Code
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
5. The container will be built and configured automatically

The DevContainer includes:
- All required Python packages
- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat and blockchain tools
- CUDA support for GPU acceleration
- PostgreSQL database
- Pre-configured extensions

### Local Development

If you prefer local development:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Run the debugging and diagnostic tool to verify your setup:
   ```bash
   python utils/debugdiag/main.py project status
   ```
