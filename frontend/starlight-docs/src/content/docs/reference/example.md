## Key Technologies

### AutoRound: Advanced Model Quantization

AutoRound now supports high-accuracy quantization (2-4 bit, INT8, QLoRA), enabling deployment of large models on diverse hardware with minimal quality loss. Integration with ONNX and TensorRT accelerates inference on edge and cloud.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP standardizes and extends context provision for LLMs and multimodal models, decoupling context from model interaction. This ensures consistent, pluggable interfaces across providers and supports advanced context chaining.

### Local and Cloud LLM Integration

Seamlessly integrate with local LLM servers (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio) and major cloud providers (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face). Hybrid workflows allow dynamic switching and load balancing.

### Distributed Agent Framework

ArtifactVirtual now includes a robust agent orchestration layer, supporting distributed, multi-agent systems for complex task automation, research, and simulation.

### Enhanced Knowledge Management

Versioned, auditable knowledge bases with support for temporal and causal relationships, enabling advanced reasoning and explainability.
