# Migration Plan: Artifact Virtual Dashboard (Angular)

## Objective
Migrate dashboard34 (React/Next.js) to a modern, modular, adaptive Angular dashboard. Ensure a unique, future-proof, and consistent experience with the Artifact Virtual stack, leveraging Angular best practices, advanced theming, and UI/UX inspiration from dashboard34.

## Implementation Progress & Checklist

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] Angular workspace created in `frontend/dashboard35` (strict mode, SCSS, routing, SSR enabled)
- [x] Angular Material and Tailwind CSS integrated
- [x] Global fonts set to Manrope/Inter (sans) and JetBrains Mono (mono) for a minimal, modern look
- [x] High-contrast teal-to-lime accent/gradient theming established (light/dark mode ready)

### 2. Core Structure & Layout
- [x] Modular folder structure: `core`, `shared`, `features`, `ui`, `services`
- [x] Core layout shell scaffolded: header, sidebar, content area, floating AVA assistant placeholder
- [x] Header: modern, minimal, responsive, with search, notifications, user controls, and gradient logo
- [ ] Sidebar: adaptive, expandable, inspired by dashboard34, with navigation groups and accent highlights (in progress)
- [ ] Floating AVA assistant: placeholder component (to be implemented)

### 3. Navigation & Routing
- [ ] Sidebar navigation: adaptive, expandable, with clear groupings and icons (in progress)
- [ ] Top header: search, notifications, user controls (done)
- [ ] Angular routes for all main dashboard sections (to do)
- [ ] Deep linking and lazy loading for feature modules (to do)

### 4. UI Components & Adaptive Design
- [ ] Recreate key UI components (cards, tabs, badges, progress, dialogs) using Angular Material/Tailwind
- [ ] Adaptive layouts: sliding panes, resizable panels, responsive grids
- [ ] Floating AVA assistant as a reusable Angular component
- [ ] Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation)

### 5. Feature Modules
- [ ] Modularize each dashboard section as a feature module (AI, Blockchain, Knowledge, Projects, Research, Servers, System, Applications, Quantum)
- [ ] Implement stateful/stateless components as needed

### 6. Services & API Integration
- [ ] Angular services for backend API endpoints (see systemmapping.md)
- [ ] HTTP interceptors for auth/error handling
- [ ] Mock data/services for local development

### 7. Theming & Styling
- [x] Tailwind/SCSS variables for color, spacing, typography ported/adapted
- [x] Gradient text, card hover, border-glow effects ready for use
- [ ] Ensure consistent look and feel with the rest of the stack

### 8. Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests for components/services (Jest/Angular TestBed)
- [ ] E2E tests for critical flows (Cypress/Angular e2e)
- [ ] CI for linting, testing, builds

### 9. Documentation & Handover
- [x] This plan.md is kept up to date as implementation progresses
- [ ] Document architecture, folder structure, and key decisions in README.md
- [ ] Add usage instructions and developer onboarding steps
- [ ] Review and validate feature parity with dashboard34

## Notes & Next Steps
- Sidebar navigation and AVA assistant are the next focus.
- Continue to reference dashboard34â€™s logic and structure, but improve modularity, adaptiveness, and theming.
- Keep this plan.md updated with each major step.
- After sidebar and navigation are complete, proceed to feature module scaffolding and routing.
