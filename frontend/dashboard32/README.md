# ArtifactVirtual Dashboard32

A next-generation, modular dashboard for orchestrating, monitoring, and managing the ArtifactVirtual AI, blockchain, and research ecosystem.

---

## Overview

**Dashboard32** is the unified control center for the ArtifactVirtual platform. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, it provides a seamless interface for interacting with AI ecosystems, blockchain environments, quantum research, knowledge management, and more. The dashboard is designed for extensibility, clarity, and real-time insight across all ArtifactVirtual projects and services.

---

## Features

- **AI Ecosystems:** Visualize, manage, and monitor AI models, pipelines, and agent systems.
- **Applications:** Launch, configure, and track ArtifactVirtual applications and services.
- **Blockchain:** Interact with blockchain networks, wallets, and smart contract deployments.
- **Knowledge Foundations:** Access datasets, knowledge graphs, and documentation.
- **Quantum & Research:** Explore quantum computing resources and research initiatives.
- **System Monitoring:** View server status, resource utilization, and diagnostics.
- **Extensible Panels:** Modular component architecture for rapid feature addition.
- **Unified Theming:** Consistent UI/UX with dark/light mode and responsive design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm/yarn
- **VS Code** (with DevContainer support for best experience)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

The dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### DevContainer

For a fully reproducible environment, open this folder in VS Code and select "Reopen in Container" (see ArtifactVirtual [DevContainer Guide](../../devcontainer/README.md)).

---

## Usage

- Navigate between panels using the sidebar or top navigation.
- Each section (AI, Blockchain, Knowledge, etc.) provides specialized dashboards and controls.
- Integrate with backend APIs and ArtifactVirtual services for live data and management.
- Customize or extend panels by adding new components to the `components/` directory and updating routes in `app/`.

---

## Architecture & Design Principles

- **Modularity:** Each dashboard panel is a standalone React component, enabling rapid development and easy maintenance.
- **Type Safety:** Built with TypeScript for robust, predictable code.
- **Theming:** Uses Tailwind CSS for consistent, theme-aware styling.
- **Extensibility:** Add new domains (e.g., quantum, research) by creating new folders in `app/` and corresponding components.
- **ArtifactVirtual Integration:** Designed to interface with all core ArtifactVirtual systems, including AI pipelines, blockchain tools, and knowledge repositories.
