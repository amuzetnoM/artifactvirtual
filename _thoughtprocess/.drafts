To do

1) set up deepeval (skip for now)

2) set up langgraph and langchain pipelines.
Proposed:

Proposed AI Pipeline Architecture
Data Ingestion & Chunking

Process: Ingest datasets (e.g., PDFs, web pages) and split them into semantically coherent chunks.

Tools: Utilize semantic chunking techniques, such as those provided by LlamaIndex, to ensure contextually relevant segments. ​

Model Selection & Routing

Process: For each chunk, determine the most suitable model to process it based on content type.

Routing Logic:

Gemma3: General language understanding and reasoning.

LLaVA: Multimodal inputs, especially image-related content.

LLaMA2-Uncensored: Handling open-ended or sensitive topics.

Model Processing

Process: Feed the chunks to the selected models via Ollama's API and collect their outputs.

Tools: Leverage Ollama's model serving capabilities to run these models locally. ​

Feedback Aggregation

Process: Aggregate the outputs from different models, annotating them with metadata such as source model, confidence scores, and content type.​

Student Model Training

Process: Use the aggregated outputs as training data to fine-tune a smaller, efficient model tailored to your needs.

Model Options: Consider lightweight models like Gemma 2B or Phi-2 for this purpose.​

Implementation Considerations
Model Serving: Set up Ollama to serve models locally, allowing for seamless API interactions. ​

Data Management: Ensure proper storage and versioning of your datasets and model outputs for reproducibility.​

Training Pipeline: Utilize frameworks like Hugging Face's Transformers and Datasets libraries to streamline the fine-tuning process.​
