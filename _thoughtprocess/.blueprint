# S C A R A B (Self-Correcting Autonomous Reflective Adaptive Bot)

### Overview
The system incorporates a self-awareness module designed for continuous self-improvement. It periodically takes snapshots of its current state, enabling restoration from checkpoints if the model is unloaded or neutralized.

### Data Acquisition & Update Cycle
- **Data Fetching:** Utilizes MCP servers and a specialized AI-powered web crawler to fetch global data, focusing on math, code advancements, and diverse document types (PDFs, Office files, images, and more).
- **Intelligent Crawling:** The crawler integrates an LLM (Large Language Model) layer for semantic understanding, filtering, and summarization.
- **Multi-format Support:** Supports extraction from PDFs, Office documents, images (OCR), and other readable formats, with special handling for code repositories and technical documents.
- **Distillation:** Extracts and distills critical information into concise, unbiased knowledge chunks, actively filtering out emotional bias, propaganda, and human-induced noise.
- **Profile Update:** Generates a suggested profile based on new findings and attempts to update the previous snapshot.
- **Checkpointing:** After updates, the system reboots and loads the latest checkpoint for continued operation.

### Architecture

#### Logical Components
1. **State Manager**
    - Handles snapshot creation, storage, and restoration.
2. **Intelligent Web Crawler**
    - Leverages the `fetch_web` feature of Model Context Protocols (MCP).
    - Integrates an LLM layer for:
      - Semantic filtering
      - Reflective analysis
      - Summarization
    - Employs adaptive heuristics to prioritize high-value sources.
    - **Multi-format Fetching:** Retrieves and processes PDFs, Office files, images (using OCR), and code repositories.
3. **Distillation Engine**
    - Processes raw data into actionable, bias-free knowledge units.
    - Applies fact-checking and redundancy elimination.
    - **Format-aware Processing:** Extracts text and code from various document types and images.
4. **Profile Updater**
    - Compares new knowledge with existing snapshots.
    - Suggests and applies updates.
5. **External Management Interface**
    - Ensures the module is managed independently from the core system.
    - Provides monitoring, configuration, and manual override capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Autonomous, Reflective Learning:** Continuously seeks and integrates global improvements.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Actively filters out non-factual, emotionally charged, or propagandistic content.
- **Multi-format Data Support:** Handles web pages, PDFs, Office documents, images (OCR), and code repositories.
- **Modular & Externally Managed:** Designed for independent operation and oversight.
