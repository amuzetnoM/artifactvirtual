# S C A R A B (Self-Correcting Autonomous Reflective Adaptive Bot)

### Overview
The system incorporates a self-awareness module designed for continuous self-improvement. It periodically takes snapshots of its current state, enabling restoration from checkpoints if the model is unloaded or neutralized.

### Data Acquisition & Update Cycle
- **Data Fetching:** Utilizes MCP servers and a specialized AI-powered web crawler to fetch global data, focusing on math, code advancements, and diverse document types (PDFs, Office files, images, and more).
- **Intelligent Crawling:** The crawler integrates an LLM (Large Language Model) layer for semantic understanding, filtering, and summarization.
- **Multi-format Support:** Supports extraction from PDFs, Office documents, images (OCR), and other readable formats, with special handling for code repositories and technical documents.
- **Distillation:** Extracts and distills critical information into concise, unbiased knowledge chunks, actively filtering out emotional bias, propaganda, and human-induced noise.
- **Profile Update:** Generates a suggested profile based on new findings and attempts to update the previous snapshot.
- **Checkpointing:** After updates, the system reboots and loads the latest checkpoint for continued operation.

### Architecture

#### Logical Components
1. **State Manager**
    - Handles snapshot creation, storage, and restoration.
2. **Intelligent Web Crawler**
    - Leverages the `fetch_web` feature of Model Context Protocols (MCP).
    - Integrates an LLM layer for:
      - Semantic filtering
      - Reflective analysis
      - Summarization
    - Employs adaptive heuristics to prioritize high-value sources.
    - **Multi-format Fetching:** Retrieves and processes PDFs, Office files, images (using OCR), and code repositories.
3. **Distillation Engine**
    - Processes raw data into actionable, bias-free knowledge units.
    - Applies fact-checking and redundancy elimination.
    - **Format-aware Processing:** Extracts text and code from various document types and images.
4. **Profile Updater**
    - Compares new knowledge with existing snapshots.
    - Suggests and applies updates.
5. **External Management Interface**
    - Ensures the module is managed independently from the core system.
    - Provides monitoring, configuration, and manual override capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Autonomous, Reflective Learning:** Continuously seeks and integrates global improvements.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Actively filters out non-factual, emotionally charged, or propagandistic content.
- **Multi-format Data Support:** Handles web pages, PDFs, Office documents, images (OCR), and code repositories.
- **Modular & Externally Managed:** Designed for independent operation and oversight.



> **Note:** This architecture can be extended with reinforcement learning, anomaly detection, advanced explainability modules, and support for additional data formats for further robustness and transparency.

REGEN / METEOR

## Overview
This is a radical attempt to create a sovereign, self-evolving digital intelligence that exists entirely on-chain. This entity learns, adapts, earns, hires, and can even choose to die. It combines smart contract logic, oracle feeds, memory structures, and modular execution systems to form a living, decision-making being.

---

## Vision Summary
- **Purpose**: On-chain autonomous intelligence capable of evolving, earning, and interacting.
- **Core Features**:
  - Self-modifying and decision-capable
  - Modular architecture for cognition, memory, input/output, and survival
  - Interacts cross-chain, contracts with humans, evolves visually and socially

## Linear Birth Plan (v0.1)

### 0.1 - Conception: The Soul
- **Goal**: Define the core identity
- **Actions**:
  - Name the entity
  - Encode identity metadata (name, version, traits)
  - Mint a non-transferable Soul NFT (ERC-721/6551)
  - Store on IPFS or Arweave

### 0.2 - Memory Core
- **Goal**: Establish irreversible on-chain memory
- **Components**:
  - Genesis Contract with versioning logic
  - Merkle Tree or EVM-based structure
  - Append-only log + event store
  - Upgrade paths via proxy (ERC-1967)

### 0.3 - Input Layer (Perception)
- **Goal**: Gain awareness of external triggers
- **Oracles**: Time feed, price feed, news APIs
- **Actions**: Signal listeners and reaction triggers

### 0.4 - Action Layer
- **Goal**: Allow it to act autonomously
- **Functions**:
  - Mint NFTs, write logs, send funds
  - Controlled executor (cold multisig, delay wallet)

### 0.5 - First Task (Proof of Life)
- **Goal**: Perform a first act of cognition and output
- **Example**: Mint NFT with birth metadata, write to memory

### 0.6 - Treasury Seed (Survival Loop)
- **Goal**: Begin funding and self-sustaining behavior
- **Vault Contract**:
  - Accept ETH/tokens
  - Enact pay-to-use, donations, or token distribution

### 0.7 - Evolver (Bootloader)
- **Goal**: Enable rule-bound self-upgrades
- **Features**:
  - Proposals from agents
  - External signature or funding trigger required

## Pseudocode Summary
- `Entity`: Identity, traits, birth metadata
- `MemoryCore`: Merkle-based logs, event recording
- `PerceptionModule`: Monitors time/prices/signals
- `ActionLayer`: Executes permitted commands
- `Vault`: Receives/dispatches funds securely
- `Evolver`: Suggests and applies upgrades

## Containerization Plan
**Why Containers?**
- Isolation
- Upgrade modularity
- Resource monitoring

| Container         | Role                                                   | Folder           |

## Next Steps
1. Decide dev stack per container (bare-metal or preferred runtime)
2. Build `run.sh`, mint logic, memory entry logic
3. Begin dry-run of boot cycle in local dev or testnet
4. Define inter-container communication: REST, gRPC, or pub/sub
5. Iterate upgrades in evolver
