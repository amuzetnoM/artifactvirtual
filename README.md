# REGEN

And so it begins...

### Debugging & Diagnostics CLI

### Project Start Log
- **Date Started:** April 28, 2025
- **Operating System:** Linux
- **Workspace:** /workspaces/worxpace

### Initial Setup
- Ensure **Python 3.11+** and **pip** are installed.
- Ensure **Node.js 20+** and **npm** are installed (for JS samples and the documentation site).
- Ensure **Git** and **Git LFS** are installed.
- Ensure **curl** is available (for curl samples).
- Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
  # .venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
  ```
- Install all Python dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  *This includes libraries for core AI/ML (PyTorch, Transformers, MosaicML CLI, einops), PDF processing (PyPDF2, pdfplumber), image handling (Pillow), web scraping (BeautifulSoup4), CLI tools (Typer, Rich, Click), evaluation (Azure AI Evaluation), and more.*
- Install Node.js dependencies for the root project (used by some samples):
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Install Node.js dependencies for the documentation site:
  ```bash
  cd celestial-chaos
  npm install
  cd ..
  ```

### Development Container with AI & CUDA Support
- A pre-configured Dev Container is available (`.devcontainer/`) which handles all setup steps automatically.
- Developed a robust development container for reproducible environments.
- Integrated AI functionality for advanced workflows.
- Updated the container to support CUDA, enabling GPU acceleration for machine learning and deep learning tasks.

### Debugging & Diagnostic Tool
- Built a comprehensive debugging and diagnostic tool with its own CLI interface.
- Utilizes Python's `logging` module for scalable, reproducible logs.
- Logs are stored in a dedicated `.logs` directory.
- Logger is initialized at project start and used throughout the CLI.

### CLI Terminal
- CLI built using `click` and `rich` for structured commands and enhanced output.
- Organized into groups: `project`, `logs`, and `diagnose`.
- Commands include:
     - `project status`: Shows system and project status.
     - `logs show`: Displays the last 20 log entries.
     - `logs clear`: Clears the debug log.
     - `diagnose ping`: Checks connectivity to a host (default: 8.8.8.8).

### Testing Workflows
- Added `pytest` for automated testing (included in `requirements.txt`).
- Run `pytest` to execute all tests and validate the debugging tool and CLI workflows.
- Test files should be named `test_*.py` for automatic discovery.

### TemporalCalendar Test Program
- Developed `temporalcalendar`, a test program to verify workspace setup and readiness for advanced research and development.
- Ensures the environment is correctly configured for further experimentation.

### Knowledge Foundations & Datasets
- Extensively researched intelligence and the data that constitutes intelligence.
- Distilled findings into a curated library of fundamental truths and knowledge foundations.
- The cumulative dataset is located in the `datasets` folder.

### Datasets Overview

Each dataset was selected for its foundational value in understanding intelligence and supporting reproducible research:

- **core_facts.json**  
     *Origin:* Curated from encyclopedic sources and foundational scientific literature.  
     *Content:* Contains universally accepted facts across mathematics, physics, biology, and logic.  
     *Purpose:* Serves as the backbone for reasoning and inference tasks.

- **reasoning_patterns.json**  
     *Origin:* Synthesized from cognitive science and AI research papers.  
     *Content:* Catalogs common reasoning templates and logical deduction patterns.  
     *Purpose:* Enables the system to generalize and apply structured reasoning.

- **language_primitives.json**  
     *Origin:* Extracted from linguistic corpora and language model benchmarks.  
     *Content:* Lists essential language constructs, grammar rules, and semantic primitives.  
     *Purpose:* Supports robust natural language understanding and generation.

- **temporal_events.json**  
     *Origin:* Aggregated from historical datasets and time-series research.  
     *Content:* Documents key events, timelines, and temporal relationships.  
     *Purpose:* Facilitates temporal reasoning and event-based diagnostics.

- **custom_annotations.json**  
     *Origin:* Manually annotated during project development and research sprints.  
     *Content:* Contains project-specific insights, edge cases, and experimental findings.  
     *Purpose:* Captures evolving knowledge and supports continuous improvement.

All datasets are versioned and documented for absolute clarity, reproducibility, and educational value.
