## Establishing Debug and Diagnostics CLI

## Project Start Log
- **Date Started:** April 28, 2025
- **Operating System:** Linux
- **Workspace:** @/worxpace/artifactvirtual/

## Initial Setup
- Ensured Python 3 and pip are installed.
- Created `requirements.txt` for dependency management.
- Installed and logged dependencies: `pip`, `datasets`, `transformers`, `rich`, `click`.

## New Dependencies
- `langchain`: Added for advanced language model workflows and orchestration.
- `langgraph`: Added for graph-based language model applications.

## Debugging Tool
- Implemented a scalable logging tool using Python's `logging` module.
- Logs are stored in a dedicated `.logs` directory for reproducibility.
- Logger is initialized at project start and used throughout the CLI.

## CLI Terminal
- Built a scalable, expandable CLI using `click` and `rich` for structured commands and beautiful output.
- CLI is organized into groups: `project`, `logs`, and `diagnose`.
- Commands include:
  - `project status`: Shows system and project status.
  - `logs show`: Displays the last 20 log entries.
  - `logs clear`: Clears the debug log.
  - `diagnose ping`: Checks connectivity to a host (default: 8.8.8.8).

## Logging for Reproducibility
- All actions, installations, and CLI operations are logged in `.logs/debug.log`.
- The logger setup ensures every significant event is recorded for traceability.

## Testing Workflows
- Added `pytest` to requirements for automated testing.
- You can now run `pytest` to execute all tests and validate the debugging tool and CLI workflows.
- Test files should be named `test_*.py` for automatic discovery.

## Achievements So Far
- Automated Python environment setup and dependency management.
- Established a robust, extensible logging system.
- Developed a modular, user-friendly CLI for debugging and diagnostics.
- Ensured all steps and changes are documented and reproducible.
