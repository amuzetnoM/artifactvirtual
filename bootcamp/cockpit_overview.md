# Cockpit Orchestrator Overview

## Purpose
The Cockpit is a LangChain/LangGraph-based orchestration engine that allows you to preprogram and preconfigure tools, and set up all post-training actions for LLMs. It enables you to "fit" a trained model into a cockpit, where it can intelligently interpret user commands, generate MVP plans, debate with a reasoning model, and execute actions in a controlled, stepwise manner.

## Key Features
- **Tool Preconfiguration:** Register and configure tools (CLI, APIs, applications) for the LLM to use.
- **Model Fitting:** Load any trained LLM into the cockpit for orchestration.
- **Intent Understanding:** Initial user prompt triggers a conversation to clarify intent.
- **MVP Planning:** LLM generates a Minimum Viable Plan (MVP) to address the user's request.
- **Debate & Reasoning:** The MVP plan is debated and refined with a logical reasoning model (e.g., another LLM or a rules engine).
- **Consensus & Execution:** Once both models agree, the plan is queued and executed stepwise, with temporal control and monitoring.
- **Extensible Orchestration:** Easily add new tools, models, or reasoning strategies.

## High-Level Flow
1. **User Prompt:** User initiates a request.
2. **Intent Parsing:** LLM interprets and clarifies intent.
3. **MVP Generation:** LLM proposes a stepwise plan.
4. **Debate Phase:** Reasoning model critiques and suggests edits.
5. **Consensus:** Both models agree on the plan.
6. **Execution Queue:** Plan steps are queued for execution.
7. **Tool Invocation:** Cockpit invokes tools as per the plan, monitors results, and handles errors.
8. **Feedback Loop:** Results are reported back to the user, and further actions can be taken.

## Technologies
- **LangChain** for agent/tool orchestration
- **LangGraph** for workflow/graph-based orchestration
- **Python** as the primary language
- **Hugging Face, OpenAI, or custom LLMs**
- **Optional:** FastAPI/Streamlit for UI, Redis for queueing, Docker for deployment
