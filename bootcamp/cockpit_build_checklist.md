# Cockpit Orchestrator Build Checklist

## Phase 1: Design & Planning
- [x] Define requirements and use cases
- [x] Select LLMs for generation and reasoning (lightweight, cutting-edge)
- [x] List and specify tools to integrate (CLI: all read/write commands, n8n automation as integration bridge, modern automation tools)
- [x] Design the orchestration flow (see detailed architecture and flow diagram below)
- [ ] Plan for extensibility and modularity

### Cockpit Orchestrator: Logical Flow & Architecture (Proposed)

#### 1. User Interaction Layer
- **User Prompt**: User submits a request (via CLI, web, or API).
- **Session Manager**: Maintains context and session state.

#### 2. Intent Understanding & Planning
- **Intent Parser Node (LLM-1)**: Lightweight LLM parses user intent, clarifies ambiguities, and extracts actionable goals.
- **MVP Planner Node (LLM-1)**: Generates a stepwise MVP plan to fulfill the intent, breaking down into atomic actions.

#### 3. Reasoning & Debate
- **Reasoning Model Node (LLM-2 or Logic Engine)**: Reviews MVP plan, critiques, suggests improvements, and checks for logical consistency, safety, and efficiency.
- **Debate/Consensus Engine**: Iterative loop between Planner and Reasoning Model until consensus is reached on the MVP plan.

#### 4. Orchestration & Execution
- **Execution Queue**: Finalized plan is queued, with each step assigned temporal and dependency metadata.
- **Tool Orchestrator (LangGraph)**: Orchestrates execution of each step, invoking the appropriate tool (CLI, n8n, etc.) and monitoring results.
- **Tool Registry**: Central registry of available tools, their capabilities, and access methods.
- **n8n Bridge**: Handles all external integrations and automations via n8n workflows.
- **CLI Executor**: Handles all internal system commands (read/write) with safety checks.

#### 5. Monitoring & Feedback
- **Result Aggregator**: Collects outputs, errors, and logs from each executed step.
- **Feedback Loop**: Reports results to the user, allows for follow-up actions or corrections.
- **Error Handler**: Detects failures, triggers recovery or rollback as needed.

#### 6. Extensibility & Modularity
- **Plugin System**: Easily add new tools, models, or logic modules.
- **Configurable Policies**: Security, rate limiting, and access control.

This architecture ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Robust debate and consensus before execution
- Full internal (CLI) and external (n8n) automation
- Extensibility for future tools and models

---

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Python project structure
- [ ] Install dependencies (langchain, langgraph, etc.)
- [ ] Implement tool registration/configuration system
- [ ] Implement model loading/fitting interface

## Phase 3: Orchestration Engine
- [ ] Build intent parsing node (LLM-based)
- [ ] Build MVP plan generation node
- [ ] Build reasoning/debate node (second LLM or logic engine)
- [ ] Implement consensus mechanism between models
- [ ] Implement execution queue and temporal control
- [ ] Integrate tool invocation and monitoring

## Phase 4: User Interaction & Feedback
- [ ] Implement user prompt interface (CLI, web, etc.)
- [ ] Implement feedback and result reporting
- [ ] Add error handling and recovery

## Phase 5: Testing & Iteration
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [ ] Test with various LLMs and toolchains
- [ ] Iterate on orchestration logic and user experience

## Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Document architecture and usage
- [ ] Provide example configurations
- [ ] Package for deployment (Docker, etc.)
