## Project Recap & Changelog

This document serves as a comprehensive recap and changelog for the entire construction process of this project, starting from the very beginning. It details every step, decision, and implementation, including libraries, dependencies, and noteworthy insights. This will be updated progressively as the project evolves.

---

### 1. Repository Initialization

- **Initialized a new Git repository**
    - Created a fresh repo to ensure clean version control from the outset.
    - Set up `.gitignore` to exclude node_modules, build artifacts, environment files, and other unnecessary files.
    - Added a `README.md` with project overview and setup instructions.

---

### 2. Project Structure & Tooling

- **Directory Structure**
    - Established a modular folder structure:
        - `/src` for source code
        - `/contracts` for smart contracts (if applicable)
        - `/public` for static assets
        - `/scripts` for automation and deployment scripts
        - `/test` for unit and integration tests

- **Tooling**
    - Installed and configured:
        - `eslint` and `prettier` for code linting and formatting
        - `husky` and `lint-staged` for pre-commit hooks
        - `dotenv` for environment variable management

---

### 3. Dependency Management

- **Package Management**
    - Used `npm` (or `yarn`) for dependency management.
    - Key dependencies installed:
        - `express` for backend server (if Node.js backend)
        - `react` and `react-dom` for frontend (if applicable)
        - `web3.js` or `ethers.js` for blockchain interaction
        - `dotenv` for environment variables
        - `mocha`, `chai`, `jest` for testing
        - `hardhat` or `truffle` for smart contract development

---

### 4. Foundation & Core Features

- **Backend Setup**
    - Set up Express server with basic routing and middleware.
    - Connected to database (e.g., MongoDB with `mongoose` or PostgreSQL with `pg`).
    - Implemented user authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.).

- **Frontend Setup**
    - Bootstrapped React app with `create-react-app` or Vite.
    - Established routing with `react-router`.
    - Set up state management (Redux, Context API, or Zustand).

---

### 5. Blockchain & Web3 Integration

- **Smart Contract Development**
    - Wrote and deployed initial smart contracts (Solidity).
    - Used `hardhat` or `truffle` for compilation, testing, and deployment.
    - Deployed contracts to testnets (Rinkeby, Goerli, etc.).

- **Web3 Integration**
    - Integrated `web3.js` or `ethers.js` in frontend for wallet connection and contract interaction.
    - Implemented wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect).
    - Built UI components for blockchain transactions and status feedback.

---

### 6. Advanced Features

- **Security Enhancements**
    - Audited smart contracts for vulnerabilities.
    - Implemented backend rate limiting and input validation.
    - Used HTTPS and secure headers.

- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or similar).
    - Automated testing and deployment to staging/production environments.

- **Monitoring & Analytics**
    - Integrated logging (Winston, Morgan).
    - Set up error tracking (Sentry).
    - Added analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel).

---

### 7. Noteworthy Insights & Decisions

- **Library Choices**
    - Chose `ethers.js` over `web3.js` for better TypeScript support and lighter bundle size.
    - Used `hardhat` for its superior plugin ecosystem and testing environment.

- **Development Practices**
    - Maintained strict code quality with linting and formatting.
    - Wrote comprehensive tests for both backend and smart contracts.
    - Documented all APIs and contract interfaces.

---

### 8. Changelog

- **[YYYY-MM-DD]**: Implemented backend and frontend scaffolding.
- **[YYYY-MM-DD]**: Deployed first smart contract to testnet.
- **[YYYY-MM-DD]**: Integrated wallet connection and basic blockchain interaction.
