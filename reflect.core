### 1. Repository Initialization

- **Initialized a new Git repository**
    - Created a fresh repo to ensure clean version control from the outset.
    - Set up `.gitignore` to exclude node_modules, build artifacts, environment files, and other unnecessary files.
    - Added a `README.md` with project overview and setup instructions.

**Date:** 2024-04-01

### 2. Project Structure & Tooling

- **Directory Structure**
    - Established a modular folder structure:
        - `/src` for source code
        - `/contracts` for smart contracts
        - `/public` for static assets
        - `/scripts` for automation and deployment scripts
        - `/test` for unit and integration tests

- **Tooling**
    - Installed and configured:
        - `eslint` and `prettier` for code linting and formatting
        - `husky` and `lint-staged` for pre-commit hooks
        - `dotenv` for environment variable management
