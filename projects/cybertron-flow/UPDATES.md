# Cybertron Flow: Comprehensive Workflow Automation Platform

Cybertron Flow is a powerful node-based workflow automation platform built with Angular. It enables users to visually design and execute complex workflows by connecting different types of nodes, each with specific functionality.

## Core Features

- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating complex workflows
- **Multiple Node Types**: Chat Agent, Integration, Scheduler, Task, Report, and Pinned Input nodes
- **Real-time Execution**: Execute workflows and view results in real-time
- **Secure Script Execution**: Run custom scripts in sandboxed environments
- **State Management**: Track workflow state and execution results
- **Import/Export**: Save and share workflows as JSON
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes and devices

## Major Enhancements

### 1. Replaced Custom Canvas Rendering with ngx-graph

The custom canvas rendering logic has been replaced with the ngx-graph library, which provides a more robust and feature-rich graph visualization:

- **Improved Performance**: Better handling of large graphs with optimized rendering
- **Advanced Edge Routing**: Smoother edge connections with proper routing algorithms
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Native support for node dragging and repositioning
- **Zoom & Pan Controls**: Smooth zooming and panning functionality with keyboard shortcuts
- **Custom Node Templates**: Enhanced node visualization with SVG-based templates
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatic layout adjustments based on graph size and complexity
- **Directed Graph Algorithms**: Proper DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) support for workflow execution
- **Edge Styling**: Customizable edge appearance with arrow markers

### 2. Implemented Secure Script Execution for Task Nodes

Task nodes now use the VM2 library to execute user-defined scripts in a secure, sandboxed environment:

- **Isolation**: Code runs in an isolated VM with no access to the file system or process
- **Resource Limitations**: Configurable memory and execution time limits
- **Allowlisted Imports**: Only approved modules can be imported by user scripts
- **Security Levels**: Preset security profiles (Low/Medium/High) for quick configuration
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and reporting for script execution failures
- **Execution Statistics**: Tracking and display of execution metrics (duration, memory usage)
- **Code Editor**: Syntax highlighting and basic code completion
- **Script Validation**: Pre-execution validation to catch syntax errors

### 3. Improved State Management & UI Architecture

The application architecture has been modernized:

- **Componentization**: Each node type now has its own dedicated settings component
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript interfaces for better type checking and developer experience
- **Reactive Updates**: Proper event-driven updates using Observables and Subject streams
- **Immutable State**: Immutable data patterns for state updates
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between state management, rendering, and business logic
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Core functionality encapsulated in Angular services
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper use of Angular's DI system for better testability
- **Configuration Management**: Typed configuration objects with defaults and validation

### 4. Added Comprehensive Icon System

Implemented FontAwesome for consistent, scalable icons throughout the application:

- **Vector Icons**: Crisp SVG-based icons that scale at any resolution
- **Semantic Icons**: Meaningful icons for each action and node type
- **Consistent Style**: Unified icon system across the application
- **Accessibility**: Icons have proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- **Custom Icon Mapping**: Specialized icons for different node types and actions
- **Performance Optimizations**: Icon subset selection to reduce bundle size
- **Theme Compatibility**: Icons that work well in both light and dark modes

### 5. Enhanced UI/UX Design

The user interface has been completely redesigned:

- **Modern Aesthetic**: Clean, professional design with improved visual hierarchy
- **Accessibility Improvements**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and proper contrast
- **Responsive Layout**: Better use of available space for different screen sizes
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states, active indicators, and status visualizations
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified color scheme, spacing, and typography
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and validation feedback
- **Modal Dialogs**: Enhanced import/export functionality with copy to clipboard
- **Tooltips and Hints**: Contextual help throughout the interface
- **Node Status Indicators**: Visual cues for execution state and errors

### 6. Enhanced Node Type Implementation

Each node type now has specialized functionality and configuration:

- **Chat Agent Nodes**: Integration with multiple LLM providers with configurable system prompts
- **Integration Nodes**: Connect to external services with authentication and data mapping
- **Scheduler Nodes**: CRON, interval, and one-time scheduling capabilities
- **Task Nodes**: Secure script execution with configurable sandbox options
- **Report Nodes**: Multiple output formats and destinations (file, email, webhook, dashboard)
- **Pinned Input Nodes**: Save and reuse input values in workflows

### 7. Additional Enhancements

- **Enhanced Node Styling**: Each node type has a distinct visual identity with semantic colors
- **Optimized Workflow Execution**: Improved execution flow and error handling with DAG-based topological sorting
- **Better Documentation**: Inline comments and expanded documentation with usage examples
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Proper integration with the permission service for secure multi-user access
- **Expanded Input Validation**: Better validation for user inputs and configurations
- **Performance Optimizations**: Reduced bundle size and improved rendering performance
- **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration tests for core components
- **Local Storage Integration**: Auto-save and workflow persistence
- **Export/Import System**: Share workflows between instances and users

## Technical Implementation

- **Framework**: Angular 16+
- **Graph Visualization**: @swimlane/ngx-graph
- **Icon System**: @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome
- **Secure Sandbox**: VM2
- **State Management**: RxJS Observables/Subjects
- **Styling**: SCSS with BEM methodology
