# Cybertron Flow Orchestrator: Progress Recap

## âœ… Completed Items
- Core Angular component for Cybertron Flow UI (`cybertron-flow.component.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`)
  - Canvas-based node graph rendering
  - Node selection, movement, and connection
  - Sidebar for node editing
  - Toolbar for adding nodes and workflow actions (run, save, export, import)
  - Zoom and pan controls
- Node types implemented:
  - Chat (AI agent)
  - Integration (external service/API)
  - Scheduler (timed/interval triggers)
  - Task (data processing/transformation)
  - Report (output formatting)
  - Pinned Input (user-pinned data/command as workflow node)
- Orchestrator service:
  - Node and edge creation
  - Node movement and selection
  - Graph rendering (nodes, edges, ports, arrows)
  - Workflow execution engine (DAG traversal, node execution, result aggregation)
  - Node execution logic for all node types (chat, integration, scheduler, task, report, pinned input)
  - Parallel workflow execution (multi-threaded/async node processing)
  - Advanced error handling and node state tracking
- LangChain service:
  - AI model text generation (local and remote models)
  - Model chaining for workflow steps
  - Model listing and config
- Scheduler service:
  - Advanced scheduling (recurring jobs, time zones, pausing/resuming jobs)
- Workflow import/export (JSON)
- Workflow save/load (localStorage and file)
- Node configuration UI for all node types
- UI/UX improvements (drag-and-drop, better edge creation, node resizing, visual feedback)
- Validation and user feedback (invalid configs, execution errors)
- Documentation and usage examples

## ðŸš€ Items To Enhance/Implement Next
- Integration node: real API calls (OAuth2, REST, GraphQL, Webhooks, etc.)
- Task node: support for custom scripts, user-defined logic, and code execution
- Report node: output to destinations beyond console (file, email, webhook, dashboard)
- Collaboration/multi-user support (real-time editing, presence, comments)
- Advanced analytics and workflow insights (usage stats, bottleneck detection)
- Pluggable node types (user-defined/custom node plugins)
- Security and access control (role-based, workflow permissions)
- End-to-end tests and CI/CD integration
- Performance optimization for large graphs and heavy workflows
- Theming and personalization (user themes, dark/light mode, custom branding)
