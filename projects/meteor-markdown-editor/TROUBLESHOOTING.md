## Installation Issues

### Node.js Version Incompatibility

**Problem:** Error messages indicating Node.js version incompatibility.

**Solution:** Ensure you're using Node.js v16 or higher.
```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node -v

# If needed, install a compatible version using nvm
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

### npm Install Failures

**Problem:** Dependency installation fails with error messages.

**Solution:** Try the following steps:
1. Clear npm cache: 
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```
2. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
3. If using Windows, ensure you have build tools:
   ```bash
   npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
   ```

## Runtime Errors

### White Screen / App Not Loading

**Problem:** Browser shows a blank screen or the app doesn't load.

**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Ensure the development server is running
3. Try a different browser
4. Clear browser cache and cookies

### "Failed to compile" Errors

**Problem:** Development server shows compilation errors.

**Solution:** Look at the specific error message:
- For TypeScript errors, check the file mentioned in the error and fix the type issues
- For import errors, ensure the path is correct and the module exists
- For syntax errors, check for missing parentheses, brackets, or semicolons

## Editor Problems

### Editor Not Updating Preview

**Problem:** Changes in the editor don't reflect in the preview pane.

**Solution:**
1. Check if you accidentally disabled auto-preview
2. Try clicking the "Refresh Preview" button
3. Restart the application
4. Check browser console for errors

### Formatting Not Working

**Problem:** Markdown formatting doesn't apply as expected.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you're using correct Markdown syntax
2. Check if your text is inside a code block (which wouldn't be formatted)
3. Verify that remark plugins are loaded correctly

### Copy-Paste Issues

**Problem:** Pasting content causes formatting issues or errors.

**Solution:**
1. Try pasting as plain text (Ctrl+Shift+V on most browsers)
2. If pasting code, make sure to paste within a code block
3. For large content, try splitting into smaller sections

## AI Features Issues

### AI Features Not Responding

**Problem:** AI buttons don't respond or generate content.

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for network errors
2. Ensure the AI model is properly loaded (look for console messages)
3. Try refreshing the page to reinitialize the AI components
4. Verify your internet connection if using remote API for AI

### Slow AI Responses

**Problem:** AI features are extremely slow to respond.

**Solution:**
1. For local AI models, your device might not have sufficient resources
2. Try reducing the model complexity in settings if available
3. Close other resource-intensive applications
4. Consider using the API-based AI option if available

### Low-Quality AI Output

**Problem:** AI suggestions or content are irrelevant or poor quality.

**Solution:**
1. Try rephrasing your prompt or input
2. Use more specific instructions in your text
3. Adjust AI parameters in settings if available
4. For content generation, provide more context in your document

## GitHub Integration Problems

### Authentication Failures

**Problem:** Unable to authenticate with GitHub.

**Solution:**
1. Check if your GitHub token has expired
2. Ensure your OAuth app settings are correct
3. Verify that you've allowed the necessary permissions
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your GitHub account

### Repository Access Issues

**Problem:** Cannot access repositories or gists.

**Solution:**
1. Verify you have proper permissions for the repositories
2. Check if you've granted the OAuth app access to those repositories
3. For organization repositories, ensure third-party access is allowed
4. Check GitHub's status page for any API issues

## Publishing Issues

### Failed to Publish Content

**Problem:** Content publishing fails with errors.

**Solution:** 
1. Check API key validity for the platform
2. Ensure all required fields are completed
3. Verify your internet connection
4. Check the platform's status page for outages
5. Look for specific error messages in the console

### Formatting Lost When Publishing

**Problem:** Published content loses formatting.

**Solution:**
1. Check if the publishing platform supports all used Markdown features
2. Some platforms have platform-specific Markdown extensions
3. Preview your content on the target platform before publishing
4. Use platform-compatible formatting options

## Performance Issues

### Slow Editor Performance

**Problem:** Editor becomes sluggish or unresponsive with large documents.

**Solution:**
1. Split large documents into smaller sections
2. Disable real-time preview for very large documents
3. Reduce the number of complex elements (tables, embedded content)
4. Check browser extensions that might interfere

### High Memory Usage

**Problem:** Application consumes excessive memory.

**Solution:**
1. Close and reopen the editor for long sessions
2. Disable unnecessary features in settings
3. Monitor and close other memory-intensive applications
4. Consider upgrading your RAM if this is a persistent issue

## Development Errors

### Build Process Failing

**Problem:** `npm run build` fails with errors.

**Solution:**
1. Check for TypeScript errors and fix them
2. Verify import/export syntax is correct
3. Look for missing dependencies in package.json
4. Check for incompatible package versions

### Hot Reloading Not Working

**Problem:** Changes to code don't trigger automatic reload.

**Solution:**
1. Check if the file watcher is functioning
2. Restart the development server
3. Verify that the file is properly imported in the application
4. Some file types might not be watched by default
