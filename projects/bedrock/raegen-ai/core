## Logical Deployment Structure: Mellum-based AI Agent System

This section outlines a fully deployable architecture for the AI Agent System, leveraging Mellum (JetBrains) as the code model, an ultra-fast local chat model, integrated RAG, and a novel onboard memory system that eliminates third-party storage dependencies.

---

### High-Level Pipeline

1. **User/Developer Interaction**
    - Users interact via a Chatbot Interface or CLI, submitting high-level goals or queries.

2. **Chat Model (Local, Efficient)**
    - An extremely fast, downloadable, and resource-efficient chat model processes user input, providing conversational understanding and intent extraction.

3. **AI Agent Orchestrator**
    - Coordinates modules, manages workflow, and delegates tasks to specialized components.

4. **Mellum Code Model Integration**
    - Mellum (JetBrains) serves as the code understanding and generation engine, handling code analysis, refactoring, and synthesis.

5. **Context Management & RAG**
    - A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module fetches relevant context from local data sources (codebase, docs, logs) using lightweight, index-based retrieval.

6. **Onboard Memory Management Unit (MMU)**
    - **No SQL/Vector/Blob Storage:** All memory is managed locally.
    - **Efficient Context Handling:** Maintains a rolling window of context, creates periodic snapshots, and uses a hybrid of:
      - **Delta Snapshots:** Only changes since the last snapshot are stored.
      - **Intuitive Indexing:** Fast lookup tables and content-addressable storage for quick recall.
      - **Counter-Intuitive Pruning:** Instead of LRU, uses task- or goal-based relevance scoring to retain critical context.
    - **Memory Snapshots:** Allow instant restoration of previous states, supporting robust undo/redo and time-travel debugging.

7. **Tool Execution & Integration Layer**
    - Executes planned actions (CLI, file ops, API calls) securely and efficiently.

8. **Feedback Loop**
    - Results are fed back to the orchestrator and user, updating memory and context as needed.

### Key Innovations

- **Mellum as Code Model:** Deep IDE-level code understanding and manipulation.
- **Ultra-Fast Local Chat Model:** No cloud dependency, instant response.
- **Onboard MMU:** Eliminates need for external databases; uses efficient, snapshot-based memory with relevance-driven retention.
- **Integrated RAG:** Lightweight, local context retrieval for enhanced reasoning.
