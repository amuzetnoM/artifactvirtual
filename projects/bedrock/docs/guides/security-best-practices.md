# Blockchain Security Best Practices

This guide outlines security best practices for blockchain development within the Bedrock environment. Following these guidelines will help minimize vulnerabilities and create more secure decentralized applications.

## Smart Contract Security

### Code Quality and Testing

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement thorough unit tests with 100% code coverage
- **Formal Verification**: Use formal verification tools to mathematically prove contract correctness
- **Test Networks**: Always deploy and test on testnets before mainnet deployment
- **Fuzzing Tests**: Employ fuzzing techniques to discover edge case vulnerabilities
- **Invariant Testing**: Define and test contract invariants that should always hold true

### Common Vulnerabilities

#### Reentrancy Protection
```solidity
// BAD PRACTICE
function withdraw(uint amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    if(success) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}

// GOOD PRACTICE
function withdraw(uint amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

#### Integer Overflow/Underflow
Use SafeMath libraries or Solidity 0.8.x+ built-in overflow/underflow protection.

#### Access Control
Implement and thoroughly test role-based access controls.
```solidity
// Example using OpenZeppelin AccessControl
contract SecureContract is AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");
    bytes32 public constant OPERATOR_ROLE = keccak256("OPERATOR_ROLE");
    
    constructor() {
        _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _setRoleAdmin(OPERATOR_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
    }
    
    function adminFunction() external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
        // Admin-only functionality
    }
}
```

### Security Tools

- **Static Analysis**: Use Slither, MythX, or Mythril to detect common vulnerabilities
- **Runtime Verification**: Implement runtime verification to detect anomalies during execution
- **Gas Analysis**: Optimize for gas efficiency without compromising security
- **Automated Auditing**: Set up CI/CD pipelines with security checks

## External Dependencies and Interfaces

### Safe External Calls
- Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Use try/catch for external calls
- Set gas limits for external calls
- Validate return values

### Oracle Security
- Use decentralized oracles when possible
- Implement time delays and multiple confirmations
- Verify data sources and implement circuit breakers

### Cross-Contract Communication
- Validate inputs from external contracts
- Don't trust external contract states
- Implement secure callback patterns

## Operational Security

### Key Management
- Use multisignature wallets for critical contracts
- Implement secure key rotation procedures
- Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs)
- Separate deployment keys from admin keys

### Upgradeability
- Use audited proxy patterns (e.g., OpenZeppelin's TransparentUpgradeableProxy)
- Implement timelock mechanisms for upgrades
- Document and test upgrade procedures
- Consider immutability for core functionality

### Emergency Procedures
- Implement circuit breakers (pause functionality)
- Create and test emergency response procedures
- Document recovery processes
- Conduct regular drills

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Anomaly Detection
- Monitor transaction patterns for anomalies
- Set up alerts for unusual activities
- Track gas usage patterns

### Incident Response
- Establish a security incident response team
- Document incident response procedures
- Create communication templates for security incidents
- Conduct post-mortem analyses

## Auditing and Review

### External Audits
- Schedule regular security audits
- Alternate between different auditing firms
- Address all findings before deployment

### Bug Bounty Programs
- Establish responsible disclosure policies
- Set up bug bounty programs
- Define scope and reward structures
