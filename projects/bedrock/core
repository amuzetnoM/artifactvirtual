# Core Blockchain Development Environment

## Project Description

This environment is designed to support blockchain development from the ground up. It enables the creation of custom blockchains, blocks, smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The primary focus is on empowering developers to build sovereign dApps and DAOs, providing the tools and languages necessary for full-stack blockchain innovation.

## Key Languages and Tools for Blockchain Development

### Blockchain-Specific Languages

- **Solidity**  
    *Role:* Primary language for smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.

- **Vyper**  
    *Role:* Security-focused alternative to Solidity for EVM smart contracts.

- **Cairo**  
    *Role:* Language for provable programs, primarily used for StarkNet smart contracts (ZK-Rollups).

- **Plutus**  
    *Role:* Native smart contract language for Cardano (Haskell-based).

- **Bitcoin Script**  
    *Role:* Limited scripting language defining spending conditions in Bitcoin transactions.

- **Marlowe**  
    *Role:* Domain-specific language for financial contracts, primarily on Cardano.

### General-Purpose Languages

- **Rust**  
    *Role:* Building high-performance core blockchain protocols (e.g., Solana, Polkadot, NEAR); writing smart contracts; developing clients and tooling.

- **JavaScript**  
    *Role:* Building dApp front-ends, interacting with smart contracts via web3 libraries (e.g., web3.js, ethers.js), and developing blockchain tools and frameworks.

- **TypeScript**  
    *Role:* Used with frameworks like Hardhat for building dApps, developer tools, and interacting with smart contracts, offering static typing for improved reliability.

### Frameworks and Libraries

- **Hardhat**  
    *Role:* Development framework for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging Ethereum/EVM smart contracts (JavaScript/TypeScript-based).

- **JavaScript/TypeScript Libraries**  
    *Examples:* `ethers.js`, `web3.js`  
    *Role:* Libraries for interacting with Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.
