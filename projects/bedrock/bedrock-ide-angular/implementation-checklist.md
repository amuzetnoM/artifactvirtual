## Technical Recommendations

### Angular Material vs. Custom Components
- The React version used Shadcn/Radix UI for components.
- Consider whether to fully embrace Angular Material or create custom components that match the original design more closely.

### State Management
- The React version used local state and React hooks.
- For Angular, consider using RxJS extensively with BehaviorSubject/Observable patterns for shared state.

### API Integration
- Leverage Angular's HttpClient for API calls with proper error handling and typed responses.
- Consider implementing interceptors for authentication and error handling.

### Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for routes.
- Use OnPush change detection where appropriate.
- Consider server-side rendering for improved initial load performance.

### Migration Order Recommendation
1. Start with core UI/layout components.
2. Implement file system and editor functionality.
3. Add compilation and deployment features.
4. Finish with AI integration and advanced features.
