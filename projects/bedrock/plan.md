# Blockchain Project Setup Checklist

## 1. Project Structure Planning

- [ ] Create the following folders and files:
    - `core/`: Language/tool documentation, shared configs, and reference code.
    - `contracts/`: All smart contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Cairo, Plutus, etc.).
    - `scripts/`: Deployment, migration, and utility scripts (JS/TS, Rust, Python).
    - `tests/`: Automated tests for contracts and protocols.
    - `clients/`: dApp frontends (React/Next.js, Svelte, etc.).
    - `rust/`: Rust-based blockchain code (protocols, clients, tooling).
    - `docs/`: Developer and user documentation.
    - `.env.example`: Template for environment variables.
    - `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.

---

## 2. Environment Preparation

- [ ] **Node.js & NPM/Yarn/PNPM**
    - [ ] Install Node.js (v20+ recommended).
    - [ ] (Optional) Use `nvm` for version management.
    - [ ] Choose and install a package manager: npm, yarn, or pnpm.

- [ ] **Rust Toolchain**
    - [ ] Install Rust via `rustup`.
    - [ ] Add target: `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (for smart contract compilation).

- [ ] **Solidity & Hardhat**
    - [ ] Install Hardhat globally or as a dev dependency.
    - [ ] Install Solidity compiler (`solc`) and Hardhat plugins (ethers, waffle, etc.).

- [ ] **Other Languages/Tools**
    - [ ] Vyper: `pip install vyper`
    - [ ] Cairo: Install via StarkNet Cairo docs.
    - [ ] Plutus/Marlowe: Install Haskell toolchain and Cardano CLI as needed.
    - [ ] Bitcoin Script: Reference tools as needed.

- [ ] **Web3 Libraries**
    - [ ] Install `ethers.js`, `web3.js`, and TypeScript types.

- [ ] **Testing & Linting**
    - [ ] JS/TS: Install `eslint`, `prettier`, `mocha`, `chai`.
    - [ ] Rust: Use `cargo test`, `clippy`, `fmt`.

---

## 3. Dependency Installation

- [ ] Initialize a new Node.js project.
- [ ] Install Hardhat and plugins.
- [ ] Install web3 libraries.
- [ ] (Optional) Install TypeScript.
- [ ] Install Rust (if not already).
- [ ] Install Vyper.
- [ ] Install Cairo (follow official docs).

---

## 4. Project Initialization

- [ ] Initialize Hardhat.
- [ ] Set up Rust workspace.
- [ ] Add example contracts in `contracts/` (Solidity, Vyper, Cairo, etc.).
- [ ] Add example Rust code in `rust/`.

---

## 5. Configuration & Scripts

- [ ] Create `.env.example` for secrets (RPC URLs, private keys).
- [ ] Add scripts to `package.json` for common tasks (build, test, deploy).
- [ ] Add `hardhat.config.js` or `hardhat.config.ts` with multi-network support.
- [ ] Add `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript.
- [ ] Add `rust-toolchain.toml` for Rust version pinning.

---

## 6. Testing & Linting Setup

- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier for JS/TS.
- [ ] Configure `cargo fmt` and `clippy` for Rust.
- [ ] Add sample tests in `tests/`.

---

## 7. Documentation

- [ ] Add a detailed `README.md` with setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- [ ] Add language/tool-specific docs in `docs/`.

---

## 8. Version Control

- [ ] Add `.gitignore` for Node, Rust, Python, and environment files.
- [ ] Commit the initial structure and configs.

---

## 9. Codespace/Devcontainer (Optional)

- [ ] (Optional) Provide a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or a `setup.sh` script for local onboarding.

---

## 10. Next Steps

- [ ] Add CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for linting, testing, and deployment.
- [ ] Add sample dApp frontend in `clients/`.
- [ ] Expand contract/test coverage.
- [ ] Document advanced workflows (multi-chain, cross-language, etc.).

---

## Summary

This checklist provides a modular, language-agnostic, and extensible blockchain development environment with minimal overhead and maximum flexibility. Proceed to initialize the Node.js and Rust projects, install dependencies, and scaffold the folder structure as described.

Let me know if you want to automate any of these steps or need code/config samples for any part!
